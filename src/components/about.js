                <strong>About Me</strong>
                <p>
                    I am a graduate from the Flatiron School where I completed the self-paced online software engneering program. I attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Springfield College before a career in professional athletics that was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    {/* Does not affect spacing */}
                    I am excited about the future of technology, especially in the areas of sports and outdoors.
